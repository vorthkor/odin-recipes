        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These vegan pancakes are light, fluffy, and <em>delicious</em>. I have been making them for years, and
            everyone that tries them wants the recipe.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl; make a well in the center. Whisk together
            water and oil in a small bowl; pour into flour mixture. Stir just until blended; mixture will be lumpy.</li>

        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</li>

        <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and edges are dry. Flip, then cook
            until bottoms are browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
